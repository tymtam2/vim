## Example VS Code setup

```bash
# Easy, turn easymotion on
"vim.easymotion": true,
# :help incsearch
#       While typing a search command, show where the pattern, as it was typed
#       so far, matches.  The matched string is highlighted.  If the pattern
#       is invalid or not found, nothing is shown.  The screen will be updated
#       often, this is only useful on fast terminals.   
"vim.incsearch": true,

#       When there is a previous search pattern, highlight all its matches.
#       The type of highlighting used can be set with the 'l' occasion in the
#       'highlight' option.  This uses the "Search" highlight group by
#       default.  Note that only the matching text is highlighted, any offsets
#       are not applied.

# Not really vim, but helps me with using [count]
"editor.lineNumbers": "relative",
